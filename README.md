This app is builded with Interaction Driver Disign software design process.

A brew introduction:
#### **Interaction-Driven Design (IDD)**
##### IDD is an iterative approach to software design and development based on Outside-In Development which focus on modelling behaviour according to the external usage of the system while maintaining an internal representation of cohesive business components.
##### IDD’s premise is that an application should only exist to satisfy the external needs of users or services — called actors. Each interaction between an actor and the application represents a need of the actor that has to be fulfilled by the application. The goal of IDD is to iteratively design and build applications that satisfy those needs.
